   <P>In this lab, I learned the basics of Git and Github. I also learned most of the basic commands for Git. Github is a good way to keep track of codebase and a better way to share code with other coders aswell. You ever wondered how people can work on one project together without changing the code and potential errors ? Well that's what Git does. It helps people collobrate on a project together.</P>
